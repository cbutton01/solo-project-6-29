## Description

One of the projects I had the most fun with during angular at Epicodus was my clone of the PCGamer landing page found here https://github.com/cbutton01/website-clone-5-25.git.  This project was built in angular and utilizes css grid.  This will be a good example of my knowledge of React, because it has several different elements that will break neatly into components and I will be able to use css objects or modules to style these components rather than a stylesheet.


The biggest difference between React and angular is that this will be a single page application.  Routing will be implemented, but routes will navigate components rather than pages.  Another key difference will be rather than using component classes like angular to generate an instance of each component I will simply be able to loop with an array in my jsx file.

### Notes

##### The Unforeseen and Questions

  * Does the shorthand for grid work with css objects?  I'm about to find out.
  * Grid is a bit more finnicky than in angular.  I am having trouble getting my article components to display the way I want them to.
  * Because of the way React is set up with app.jsx I'm finding it difficult to line my background image up the way I want it to look.
  * The links will not stop being blue and underlined, and I don't know why.
